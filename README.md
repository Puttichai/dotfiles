# dotfiles

A personal repository for dotfiles.

## Instructions

After cloning this repository to your local computer, execute `create_symlinks.sh` only once by typing
```{.bash}
./create_symlinks.sh
```

This command will create symbolic links in your home directory pointing to the dotfiles.
Any changes made to these files will then be automatically tracked.

You will need to make sure that before executing `create_symlinks.sh` there is no file in your home directory with the same name as any dotfiles here.
